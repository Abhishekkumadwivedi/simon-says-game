# simon-says-game
Simon Says is a game where one player (Simon) gives commands to others. If Simon starts the command with "Simon says," players must obey. If the command doesn't start with "Simon says," players must ignore it. Players who follow commands without "Simon says" or ignore ones with it are out. The last player remaining wins.
